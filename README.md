## Introduction

Given an m x n integer grid accounts, where accounts[i][j] represents the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank, this project calculates the wealth of each customer. A customer's wealth is the sum of the money they have in all their bank accounts. The project then identifies the richest customer, who is the one with the maximum wealth, and returns their wealth.

## Getting Started

To use this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/richest-customer-wealth.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd richest-customer-wealth


## Example
For example, consider the following input:
accounts = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [3, 2, 1]
]
The wealth of each customer is calculated as follows:

1st customer: wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer: wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest, each with a wealth of 6, so the output will be 6.



## Usage

This project is implemented in Java and uses a function maximumWealth to calculate the richest customer's wealth.
You can call the maximumWealth function with the accounts array as the input to calculate the richest customer's wealth.
